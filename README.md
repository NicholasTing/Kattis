Competitive Programming Questions

I decided to post my open.kattis.com solutions online to track my progress and help those in need.

DISCLAIMER:
I do not promote plagiarism in any way. Try not to copy my solutions and think of it yourself. 
Think of this as a guide, just in case you get stuck.
Most of the solutions here are to the easy-medium questions.

Programming mostly in Python and C/C++.
Will try to do some in Java in the near future
